# HiveVM - Development Tools based on Modelling

Official website and documentation for HiveVM, a software modeling platform for developing enterprise software solutions.

## Overview

HiveVM is rethinking software development through a model-driven architecture approach. Instead of traditional programming, HiveVM empowers developers to design software solutions through modeling, enabling:

- **Technology independence**: Solutions are not tied to specific technologies
- **Low-code development**: Reduce reliance on manual programming
- **Rapid prototyping**: Implement solutions and iterate quickly
- **Sustainable solutions**: Models can be updated without full reimplementation

## Core Products

### 1. [Parser Generator](https://github.com/hivevm/cc)
LL(k) parser generator for context-free grammars. Generates parsers and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for Java and C++.

### 2. [Manual Generator](https://github.com/hivevm/doc)
Documentation tool for collections of markdown documents. Supports CommonMark syntax with professional manual generation capabilities.

### 3. [Gradle Workflow](https://github.com/hivevm/gradleDevOps)
Gradle-based CI/CD pipeline engine enabling workflow definition for heterogeneous build systems.

## Vision
